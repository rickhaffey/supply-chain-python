## Lesson 01


* sandwich shop example
    * make to order: packaged, ready made turkey wrap
    * make to stock: signature ham sandwich
    * engineer to order: one-of-a-kind Dagwood

* pull vs push processes
    * push
        * execute in _anticipation_ of an order
        * demand is forecasted
        * proactive
        * -> (-) higher inventory
        * -> (-) potential for spoilage / imbalance
        * -> (+) faster cycle time
    * pull
        * execute in _response_ to an order
        * demand is actual/known/certain
        * reactive
        * -> {basically, the opposites of push}    
    * mixed systems more common than pure push / pull systems
        * push / pull boundary
        * push undifferentiated, raw products / components
        * pull finished product
        * -> (+) allows for efficient mass customization (postponement)
        * -> (+) allows for pooling of products; aggregating demand
    * key principles
        * maximize external variety / minimize internal variety
        * keep in-process inventory as raw as possible (RAP) 
        
* segmentation
    * products, customers, suppliers, etc.
    * only makes sense if there are differences in buying, making, moving, storing, or selling
    
* segmentation rules-of-thumb:
    * Homogeneous: **similar within** segments
    * Heterogeneous: **different across** segments
    * Critical Mass: should be **big enough** to make worthwhile
    * Pragmatic: should be **useful and communicable**
    
* customer / supplier segment dimensions: lead time, service level, purchase history,
order size/volume, geography, demographic, sales trends, channel segmentation,
strategic importance

* produce segment dimensions: 
    * physical characteristics: value, size, density, etc.
    * demand characteristics: sales volume, volatility, sales duration, etc.
    * supply characteristics: availability, location, reliability, etc.
    
    
    
* Product distribution in terms of sales volume
    - % of skus vs. % of sales volume

* Power Law: $y=ax^k$
    * The **important few** versus the **trivial many**
    * **fundamental insight**: distribution of many phenomena across a population
    follow a Power Law relationship
    
### ABC Analysis

* Class A: the important few
    * impact: HIGH
    * volume: LOW
    * exceptions: HIGH
    * expected automation: LOW
    * expected management involvement: HIGH    
* Class B: the middleshare
* Class C: the trivial many
    * impact: LOW
    * volume: HIGH
    * exceptions: LOW
    * expected automation: HIGH
    * expected management involvement: LOW

* Analysis Steps
    1. Identify the SKUs that management should spend time on
    1. Prioritize SKUs by their value to the firm
    1. Create logical groupings
    1. Adjust as needed
* Typical segmentation
    * Class A: 80% of Value / 20% of SKUs
    * Class B: 15% of Value / 30% of SKUs
    * Class C: 5% of Value / 50% of SKUs
  
Alternate Segmentation Methods

* economic value vs. demand variability:
    * volatile (high value + high variability)
    * stable (high value + low variability)
    * unimportant (low value)
    
    
Segmentation: Innovative (e.g. latest smartphone) vs. Functional (e.g. Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup)


### Handling Uncertainty

* managing to "mean"" is rarely sufficient
* often helpful to assume a probability distribution:
    * Normal: continuous, symmetric, commonly used
    * Log-normal: continuous, skewed right, many supply chain applications
    * Poisson: discrete, common for low valued distributions, 
    probability of $x$ events occurring within a time period
    
    
## Lesson 02

Introduction to Demand Planning & Forecasting

Demand Process - Three Key Questions

* What should we do to shape and create demand for our product? => Demand Planning
* What should we expect demand to be given the demand plan in place? => Demand Forecasting
* How do we prepare for and act on demand when it materializes? => Demand Management


Forecasting Levels

* Strategic
  - year/years
* Tactical
  - quarterly
  - months/weeks
* Operational
  - days/hours
  
  
Forecasting Truisms

* Forecasts are always wrong
    * => use ranges & track forecast error
* Aggregated forecasts are more accurate
    - aggregate by sku, time, location, etc.
    - coefficient of variation (CV) reduces as we aggregate
    * => risk pooling reduces CV
* Shorter horizon forecasts are more accurate
    * => postpone customization until as late as possible
    
* Approaches

    * Subjective
        - judgmental     
        - experimental
    * Objective
        - causal / relational
        - time series
        
Forecasting Quality

Accuracy vs. Bias

* Forecasting Metrics
    * Mean Deviation (MD) 
    * Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)
    * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
    * Mean Percent Error (MPE)
    * Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE)
